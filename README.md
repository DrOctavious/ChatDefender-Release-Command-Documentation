# ChatDefender-Release-Command-Documentation

# About ChatDefender
ChatDefender has been long coded since the summer of 2017. *There is no set date for it*<br>
ChatDefender is a high-end chat moderation bot. This bot goes from command logging to timers. All commands are stored in seperate files for great organization. The permissions for commands are customizeable, except for a few due to abuse or just should not be in the wrong hands of others. You will see an error that says "so and so cannot be changed". Due to many people being confused as to how things work, I have made this guide that shows how a command should be used alongside all options of it. They are in order as `Manager, Staff, and User` with a little description about each of them.

> Note: These are examples on how to use the commands. There are a few restrictions and I will note them.
